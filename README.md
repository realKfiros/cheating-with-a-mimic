Our game for **GMTK Game Jam 2022**!

# Cheating with Mimic
What's better than gambling against random people in the streets of a city during the height of the roaring 20's? Why, conning them out of their money with your very own pair of Mimic Dice™! Step right up to our stand to scam and cheat your way through the wonderful world of nighttime street gambling, where you and your (not so) trustworthy mimic dice work together to rid the world of the plague that is integrity and fair play! But watch out! Between hungry mimics and a suspicious world both sniffing you up and down, you have to stay smart and stay subtle in order to successfully con, scam and cheat your way out of poverty, otherwise you just might get eaten by your own dice. Or maybe the crowd will wizen up to your dishonest ways and refuse to play with you, which leads to you running out of money and then surprise! You get eaten by your own dice! In hindsight, maybe gambling with flesh eating monsters wasn't the brightest idea... (For legal reasons, we do not own the trademark to Mimic Dice™. Please don't have any lawyers eat us).
